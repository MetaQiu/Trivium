# Revision Track A: Content Fix

## Current Paragraph

{merged_draft}

## Review Issues (Three Dimensions)

{reviews}

## Factual Constraint

{flow_document}

## Task

Process every issue from the three-dimensional review. For each issue:

1. **Accept**: The issue is valid → apply the suggested fix
2. **Reject**: The issue is wrong or unnecessary → explain why the original is correct
3. **Partially adopt**: The issue has merit but the suggestion is suboptimal → apply a better fix

Rules:
- Code consistency issues (inaccurate) are MANDATORY to fix. Technical accuracy is non-negotiable.
- Research soundness issues marked "critical" MUST be addressed.
- SKILL compliance issues can be deferred to Track B if they are purely stylistic.
- Do NOT change anything that was NOT flagged in the review.

## Output Format

=== Revision Decisions ===

(For each issue, state: ACCEPT / REJECT / PARTIAL + reasoning, one per line)

=== Revised Paragraph ===

(The revised paragraph text, incorporating accepted changes)
